## Problem Statement ##
Implement a circuit that returns |01> and |10> with equal probability.  
**Requirements for the task**  
- The circuit should consist only of CNOTs, RXs and RYs. 
- Start from all parameters in parametric gates being equal to 0 or randomly chosen. 
- You should find the right set of parameters using gradient descent (you can use more advanced optimization methods if you like). 
- Simulations must be done with sampling - i.e. a limited number of measurements per iteration and noise. 
- Compare the results for different numbers of measurements: 1, 10, 100, 1000.

**Requirements met**  
- Ideal circuit involving just one RY and CNOT gate each. :D
